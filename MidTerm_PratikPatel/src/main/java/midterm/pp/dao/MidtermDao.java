	Description - The code to implement the CRUD operations, like insert, would go here.
	But, the midTerm practical partB states "You are not asked to do database code or CRUD operations in this part.  
	Only doing Client side validation". So, this file is empty. We would connect to the database here and use 
	PreparedStatement to securely send data to the database. We would call the getter and setter from MidtermApp.java and use
	positional parameters or '?' to create a query to the database. This will protect the application from SQL injections.
